# resolute

A class project at MIT.  See poster.pdf for details.  Note that the experiment results in the poster are not rigorous (as the project deadline was approaching), but one could redo them more carefully with the code here.

To train a model which attempts to replicate the original paper, run
```
python train.py --experiment-type 0
```
